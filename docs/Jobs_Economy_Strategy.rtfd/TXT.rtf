\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec4 This is a critical year\'a0for Labour to set out the case for\'a0change:\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for a fairer, greener and\'a0more dynamic Britain, where aspiration\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is rewarded, where working people succeed and where\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 communities control their own destiny.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 There can be no doubt that Britain faces serious challenges, nor that 13 years of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Conservative government have left our country, our economy and our public services\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 on their knees and vulnerable to those challenges. But there should also be no doubt that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 we can rise to them.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 We believe in our country and our people. What they lack is a government that shares\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 their ambition.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 We need to show people that Labour would be that government. Show not just\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 what the Tories have done to Britain but the Britain that Labour can build. A country\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 run in the interests of working people, and where politics is once again a force for good.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 This requires a bold and credible policy agenda \'96 and the National Policy Forum plays a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 critical role in getting us there.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 These will be the \uc0\u64257 nal NPF consultations before Labour \u64257 nalises our manifesto for the next\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 election, and they are a vital opportunity for us to hear from voices across the labour\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 movement and country on some of the most pressing policy issues facing an incoming\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour government.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 They look at the ways Britain can prosper by ensuring growth in every part of our country,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 by forging new, ethical trading relationships and by improving our everyday economy.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 They consider how better public services, focused on prevention and early intervention,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can make us happier, healthier and safer. They look at how we can support families in all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 their wonderful diversity, and how by pushing power out of Westminster we can make our\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 neighbourhoods and communities more cohesive and prosperous.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Please do contribute your thoughts and ideas. The strength of our movement is its\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 diversity, and that is nowhere more apparent than in our democratic policymaking\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 process. It is important that we are able to draw on the thoughts and experiences of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 our members, a\uc0\u64259 liates, stakeholders and supporters.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Together we can give Britain\'a0the fairer, greener future it\'a0deserves.\cf0 \cb1 \

\cf2 \cb3 Thank you for taking part in the Labour Party\'92s\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 2023 National Policy Forum (NPF) consultation.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 This is the \uc0\u64257 nal of four annual consultations before\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the next general election and will form a key input\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to the manifesto-drafting process.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 As we further develop our policy platform,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 it is particularly important that we hear from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people across the labour movement, including\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 from local Labour Parties and a\uc0\u64259 liated trade\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 unions. We also encourage external organisations,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 such as charities, think tanks, businesses and civil\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 society bodies to submit their ideas.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Members should contribute to discussions and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 submissions through their constituency or branch\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 party, as the commissions will not be accepting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 submissions directly from individuals in this \uc0\u64257 nal year.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Labour Party is publishing six consultation\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 documents this year. Each asks a set of seven\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 questions on a speci\uc0\u64257 c policy area, followed by\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 detail on the context and the challenges we face.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 After the consultation closes on 17 March, all\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of the submissions from the four years\'92 worth of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 consultations will be used to develop \uc0\u64257 nal year\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 policy documents. Those documents will then\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be debated, amended and agreed by the NPF\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 representatives in a \uc0\u64257 nal meeting on 21-23 July.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 You may wish\'a0to look at the\'a0work of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour Party\'92s\'a0policy roadmap, Stronger\'a0Together,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 which produced\'a0a \uc0\u64257 nal\'a0report, structured\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 around the same six policy themes, in 2022:\cf0 \cb1 \

\cf6 \cb3 Introduction\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 The National Policy Forum (NPF) is entering the \uc0\u64257 nal year of the current policy cycle,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 which will culminate in a full, in-person meeting of the NPF to determine Labour\'92s policy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 platform. That platform will in turn contribute towards an election-winning manifesto for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the next general election.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Better Jobs and Better Work policy commission and its predecessor commissions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have consulted on a range of policy topics over the previous three years:\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0In\'a02020,\'a0on\'a0Economic\'a0recovery\'a0and\'a0renewal\'a0after\'a0coronavirus.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0In\'a02021,\'a0on\'a0Repairing\'a0the foundations\'a0for\'a0a\'a0stronger,\'a0fairer\'a0economy.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0In\'a02022,\'a0on\'a0Guaranteeing\'a0good\'a0work\'a0in\'a0the\'a0modern\'a0workplace.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 For this fourth and\'a0\uc0\u64257 nal year, the Better\'a0Jobs and Better Work policy commission has\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 chosen to focus on the everyday economy. We welcome submissions on this issue \'96\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and speci\uc0\u64257 cally the seven consultation questions set out below \'96 from Constituency\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and Branch Labour Parties, a\uc0\u64259 liated trade unions and socialist societies, as well as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 contributions from expert third party organisations such as charities, think tanks,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 businesses and civil society. Full details on how to make a submission can be found\cf0 \cb1 \

\f1\b \cf2 \cb3 www.policyforum.labour.org.uk.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 The outcomes of all four consultations will then be taken into account when the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 commission produces its draft policy document for consideration at the full NPF\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 meeting in July 2023.\cf0 \cb1 \

\f0 \cf7 \cb3 \strokec7 The context\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 Since the last consultation cycle, a deepening energy crisis and a litany of Conservative policy failures\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 means the UK is facing a bleak economic outlook.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The cost of living crisis also continues unabated with 2023 looking set to be a dire one for living standards as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the price of energy and other essentials is expected to stay elevated. Meanwhile, higher interest rates are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 feeding through into higher borrowing costs for families and businesses, while homeowners face steep rises\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in monthly mortgage payments.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 A series of Conservative economic policy failures have left us uniquely exposed to this crisis, including\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 decisions to wind down gas storage capacity, failure to insulate our ageing housing stock, dither and delay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 on nuclear and e\uc0\u64256 ective bans on cheap renewable energy like onshore wind.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 This year\'92s consultation cycle has been framed around the \'91everyday economy\'92 which is those parts of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 economy which keep\'a0our country moving and\'a0society functioning. It is made up of the private and public\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf2 \cb3 sectors and includes health, social care, retail, utilities, transport, post, child care, construction, education\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and food.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The everyday economy has been overlooked and undervalued by the Conservatives and this has weakened\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 our country\'92s foundations. Neglect of areas that support the everyday economy, such as skills and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 enforcement, has led to low pay, low productivity and inadequate progression.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The pandemic showed the importance of key workers and yet still too many jobs are low paid, insecure and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the Government has no strategy to address this.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 While policymakers are rightly concerned with the immediate energy crisis, the long-term outlook for growth\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and prosperity, in the everyday economy and beyond, remains grim.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 13 years of stagnation and low growth has left our economy wholly unprepared and lacking in resilience. It is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 no surprise the International Monetary Fund expects the UK to have the lowest growth and lowest in\uc0\u64258 ation of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 any major advanced economy over the next two years.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Government has no real plan for growth and has already caved to their own backbenchers on key\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 measures around housebuilding and renewable energy.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Prime Minister has no vision for capitalising on the opportunities around net zero and seems content to let\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 potential jobs, investment and growth slip away to other countries.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Government also look set to repeat the failures of the past decade, where some welcome progress in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 renewable generation has failed to deliver jobs in the UK because of avoidable policy mistakes.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Conservatives continue to ask working people to foot the bill for their economic failures \'96 picking their\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 pockets \uc0\u64257 rst with huge tax hikes, while the mega-rich and energy giants enjoy untargeted tax breaks.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 After 13 years of Conservative government our public services are in crisis with many increasingly struggling\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to provide the service expected of them and meet demand. There are growing recruitment and retention\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 crises among many workforces and the government has repeatedly failed to address this, which has directly\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 contributed to industrial action.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Conservatives have sought to sow division and stoke political \uc0\u64257 ghts instead of trying to \u64257 nd solutions,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 proposing new unworkable and unfair restrictions on trade union activity that threaten to further undermine\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 workers\'92 rights and living standards instead of negotiating and resolving issues.\cf0 \cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 In contrast to the Conservatives\'92 dismal record, Labour has set out bold and credible proposals to grow the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 economy, ensure good work and break the UK out of our current cycle of stagnation.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour\'92s plans for prosperity and growth build on the work of previous policy development cycles and on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 other work including its New Deal for Working People.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour will do things di\uc0\u64256 erently, recognising that real and sustained economic growth comes from the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 bottom-up and middle out and not discredited \'91trickle down\'92 approaches.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 At the core of all of Labour\'92s policies is the principle that growth comes from working people and does not\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 trickle-down from the top. The failure of the \'91trickle-down\'92 ideology was laid bare in 2022 and has made the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 need for a clear alternative even more pressing.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour is clear Britain\'92s wealth is created by the talents and e\uc0\u64256 orts of millions of working people and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 businesses across our country.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour\'92s plans include the Prosperity Through Partnership framework for industrial strategy announced at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Annual Conference 2022 and the Green Prosperity Plan, with a National Wealth Fund to invest in all regions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and nations and GB Energy, a publicly owned national energy champion. It also includes plans to overhaul\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the failing apprenticeships system, with reform to the apprenticeship levy and new Skills England body to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 oversee local skills provision.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 A number of independent economic policy reviews have reported to the Party since the last cycle.\cf0 \cb1 \

\f3\i \cf2 \cb3 \'a0A New Britain: Renewing our democracy and rebuilding our economy,\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\i0 \cf2 \cb3 the \uc0\u64257 nal report of the Commission\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 on the UK\'92s Future, headed by former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, published a wide-ranging\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 framework for economic devolution in England to drive the growth of new internationally competitive\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 economic clusters.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\i \cf2 \cb3 Start-up, Scale-up,\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\i0 \cf2 \cb3 the review led by Lord Jim O\'92Neill, looked at barriers to \uc0\u64257 nance for new and fast-growing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 businesses, with a series of detailed proposals to support Labour\'92s ambition to make Britain the high growth,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 start-up hub of the world. Proposals look at crowding-in more institutional investment, the role of the British\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Bank, universities and spin-outs, the role of procurement and a number of existing schemes aimed at\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 entrepreneurs.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour\'92s Council of Skill Advisors, headed by former Labour Education Secretary Lord Blunkett, published its\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 independent report on the skills system with a number of proposals to overhaul skills provision in the UK.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Prosperity Through Partnership outlines how Labour would work with unions, businesses, local leaders and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 workers to drive prosperity. The strategy sets a clear direction for Labour\'92s Industrial policy including how\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour will work across sectors to boost economic growth, investment, resilience, and employment rights.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The industrial strategy also looks at the wider regulatory landscape for the everyday economy and other\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sectors, discussing levers such as competition policy, corporate governance and procurement. These\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 frameworks will ensure dynamic, competitive markets that reward innovation and long-termism while\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 protecting rights and standards.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The strategy looks not only to the technological frontier, but to the everyday economy sectors that make up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the bulk of the UK workforce and are too often overlooked in economic strategies.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Evidence suggests the UK\'92s everyday economy underperforms internationally, due to a combination of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 low investment, low uptake of technology and an overly precarious labour market that works against\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 progression, productivity and higher pay.\cf0 \cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 Labour\'92s New Deal for Working People provides some of the groundwork to support the everyday economy,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 such as Fair Pay Agreements, ending one-sided \uc0\u64258 exibility and bee\u64257 ng up enforcement.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 These proposals will ensure businesses compete on innovation and quality rather than driving down\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 standards and operating a poorly managed, precarious, low-paid workforce.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 This year\'92s consultation will look in further detail at some of the policy issues a\uc0\u64256 ecting businesses and workers\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in the everyday economy.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 In the previous cycle, the commission also looked at issues relating to technology and automation in the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 workforce, exploring ways to ensure these trends bene\uc0\u64257 t workers and do not lead to a further erosion of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 standards and conditions. This year\'92s consultation will seek to build on some of these areas in more detail.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Previous cycles have also looked at some of the problems and unfairness in our tax system that allow some\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to get away without paying their fair share, including pro\uc0\u64257 t shifting by multinationals, online giants and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 loopholes enjoyed by private equity fund managers and non-doms. The cycle will look to build on this work\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and build out an evidence base, looking at how can make Britain\'92s taxation system fairer for everyone\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 whether they are employed, self employed in a challenging economic climate.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 At Annual Conference 2022, Labour made new pledges to ensure investment is used to create good jobs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in all parts of the UK, with proposals on using public buying power to promote best practice, high pay,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 progression, skills, opportunities for business bene\uc0\u64257 ts and trade union representation.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour also set out plans to ensure smaller \uc0\u64257 rms and the self-employed are not locked out of public\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 contracts, cutting red tape and making the process simpler, calling time on a series of scandals propagated\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 by outsourced giants.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The pandemic showed us that a decade of Conservative government had shattered the resilience of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 British businesses, services and our local economies. Instead of trusting decent British \uc0\u64257 rms to deliver services,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0jobs and a better future, big contracts were given to Conservative cronies and unquali\uc0\u64257 ed providers. The\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Conservatives eroded standards at work, encouraging a race to the bottom.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 From the Welsh Government, to Metro Mayors and local government across the country, Labour in power\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 is showing how things can be done better. Labour is unleashing the power of procurement to rebuild local\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 economies and create more and better jobs.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 People want good jobs, investment in their communities and a system that will put their interests \uc0\u64257 rst. A\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 public procurement policy that the public can trust will make the awarding of contracts a force for good,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 while backing the British businesses and workers who are creating this country\'92s wealth.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour in government is ready to take on this mantle, utilising what the Labour Party has learnt in power\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 regionally and locally to build a new guarantee for the British public. This consultation cycle will look in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more detail about how the UK can stop lurching from crisis to crisis to boost the resilience of our everyday\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 economy and make procurement deliver for Britain. The consultation will also look at the everyday\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 economy in the public sector and the speci\uc0\u64257 c levers that are relevant there, including skills provisions,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 insourcing and procurement.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 These policies are particularly important in light of Labour\'92s Green Prosperity Plan, with investment in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 domestic renewables, nuclear, hydrogen and green industries.\'a0Avoidable mistakes and\'a0policy failures from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the Conservatives have seen increased renewable energy generation not drive a similar rise in good jobs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 based here in the UK\cf0 \cb1 \
