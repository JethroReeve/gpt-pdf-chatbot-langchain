\f2 \cf5 \cb3 \strokec5 A green and digital future\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf5 \cb3 The context\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 Britain has extraordinary economic potential. Yet the country are in the midst of the worst cost of living crisis\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in 40 years and the economy is shrinking.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Conservatives have failed to protect working people from rising prices. While Labour has consistently\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 called for energy prices to be frozen, the government has allowed them to soar. Working people are picking\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 up the bill, while oil and gas giants are getting a tax break thanks to the windfall tax loophole.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The UK entered this crisis more vulnerable than we should have been because the Conservatives have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 failed over 13 years to grow the economy, leaving us less prosperous and more insecure. On top of a lost\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 decade of growth, the UK is the only G7 economy that is smaller than before the pandemic. And we are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 forecast to have the slowest growth in the G7 over the next two years.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Low growth is re\uc0\u64258 ected in declining living standards across the country. Real wages are lower in every\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 region of Great Britain than they were in 2010. On average, people are earning \'a31,600 less per year than\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they were when Labour was last in government.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Driving weak growth is the lowest rate of business investment in the G7. Businesses need stability and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 certainty but the Conservatives have overseen a chaotic economic environment. They\'92ve broken their own\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \uc0\u64257 scal rules 11 times, undermined independent economic institutions and shunned economic warnings that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have led to higher mortgages and borrowing costs for the UK. The botched Brexit deal continues to cause\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 di\uc0\u64259 culties for exporters.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 To rebuild Britain, we need to improve our technological capabilities and compete on a global stage. Yet\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the Government scrapped its industrial strategy, leaving the UK falling behind in the race for the jobs of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the future, many of which will be in green and digital industries. Our world-leading research capabilities in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 science and technology too often fail to translate into growth in the high-tech sectors which could provide\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 good jobs across the country. Despite much talk about \'91levelling up\'92, there continue to be stark di\uc0\u64256 erences\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in income between di\uc0\u64256 erent regions in the UK.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Digital technologies have the potential to be a signi\uc0\u64257 cant source of growth. But businesses are still waiting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for regulatory clarity and poor digital infrastructure is holding growth back.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 A chronic lack of investment has created high-cost, low-reliability utilities and public services, including the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 transport network. When people cannot reliably and a\uc0\u64256 ordably travel to work, the whole economy su\u64256 ers.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Russia\'92s illegal invasion of Ukraine has exposed just how insecure the UK\'92s energy system has become under\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the Conservatives, contributing to higher bills for everyone. The Conservatives have failed to invest in energy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 security, severely cutting energy e\uc0\u64259 ciency programmes and e\u64256 ectively banning new onshore wind projects.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 This leaves people facing higher bills, businesses less competitive and growth dampened.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Government has neglected its role as a partner for businesses and unions. They scrapped their industrial\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 strategy, leaving businesses without the certainty and clarity they need. And they have frequently refused\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to sit down with unions, forcing them into the largest wave of strikes in a generation.\cf0 \cb1 \

\f0 \cf5 \cb3 The future under Labour\'a0\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 Labour would unlock Britain\'92s\'a0potential by creating a\'a0fairer, greener, more dynamic\'a0economy that delivers\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 better jobs and living standards for working people. A Labour government would secure growth that is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sustainable, and that is both driven by and delivering for all communities and groups.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Science and technology policy\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf2 \cb3 Labour has a vision for the UK to lead the world once again in high-tech industries. Labour would build on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 our strengths in science and technology, aiming for at least three per cent of GDP to be invested in research\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and development (R&D). Labour is proud of the foundational research conducted by universities, and the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 public good that produces. But Labour also thinks also think we can do better at translating the UK\'92s research\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 successes into growth and jobs across the country. The Commission on the UK\'92s Future highlighted the regional\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 challenges the UK faces on R&D and recommended a reformed suite of place-based R&D programmes.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Start-Up Review highlighted the potential to improve the pipeline of spinouts emerging from universities.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \AppleTypeServices \cf2 \cb3 The digital economy\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 Labour believes that to unlock the economic potential of digital technologies, it is necessary to shape\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 them for public good. Therefore, Labour would act to ensure that systems are safe, trustworthy and reliable.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour would use data to drive better outcomes for public services and open up more data for the bene\uc0\u64257 t\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of researchers and small businesses. Labour\'92s pro-innovation regulatory regime would ensure the UK\'92s data\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ecosystem is secure and trusted, providing certainty to businesses and delivering better outcomes for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 consumers. To avoid unnecessary trade barriers, Labour would maintain Britain\'92s data adequacy status with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the EU.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 A Labour government would also address the huge power some digital platforms have over consumers and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 workers, with a robust and agile competition and regulatory regime, which would help level the playing \uc0\u64257 eld\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for smaller \uc0\u64257 rms, creating more competitive markets and enabling new services. And a Labour government\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 would ensure everyone can bene\uc0\u64257 t from digital technologies, ensuring the UK has world-leading digital\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 infrastructure, with every home connected.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Transport\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 The UK\'92s transport network is failing to provide reliable, a\uc0\u64256 ordable and clean options for millions of people.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 This is a drag on growth, with people unable to travel reliably to work, school or the high street.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Too many rail operators are pro\uc0\u64257 ting from failure. The problem is especially bad in the North of England\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 where it is common for hundreds of services to be cancelled every day. Labour would end the failed\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 experiment of railway privatisation and bring services back into public ownership as contracts expire.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 And a Labour government would build High Speed 2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail in full.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour would also give the public more control over bus services. Labour would give local communities\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that want it the power to set bus routes and fares, following the path set by Labour mayors in Greater\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Manchester, West Yorkshire and Liverpool City Region.\'a0It is only by improving services that buses will\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 become a more reliable option for many people.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Public transport is not always an option, especially in rural areas. To reach net zero, Britain also needs to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 decarbonise private transport, which is why Labour would build electric vehicle supply chains in the UK\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and roll out charging infrastructure. Labour would also develop more active travel options including walking\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and cycling.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Green prosperity\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 Labour believes the best way to grow the economy is to win the global race for the industries and jobs of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 tomorrow, many of which will be in the green economy. Labour\'92s Green Prosperity Plan will create one\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 million good jobs in new industries and businesses in all parts of the country.\cf0 \cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 The next Labour Government will launch an urgent mission for a net zero-emission electricity system by 2030,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 making the UK a clean energy superpower, exporting clean power to the rest of the world.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 To achieve this, the next Labour government will establish Great British Energy, a new national champion\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in clean power generation. Labour would create a National Wealth Fund to build British industry, investing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in electric car battery manufacturing, green steel and clean energy including on and o\uc0\u64256 -shore wind and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 nuclear\'a0power.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Delivering on these pledges will require mobilisation from government and the private sector to overcome\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 barriers. For example, a Labour government would turbocharge planning decisions for energy projects, to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 bring the decision timeline down from years to months.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Industrial strategy\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 At the heart of Labour\'92s approach will be a modern industrial strategy. At Annual Conference 2022, Labour\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 set out its industrial strategy\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 1\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 \'a0vision centred on a partnership between government, business and unions to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 grow the high-tech, competitive industries of the future.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour\'92s industrial strategy is centred around four missions:\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'95 Delivering clean power by 2030\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0Harnessing\'a0data\'a0for\'a0public\'a0good\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0Caring\'a0for\'a0the\'a0future\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0Building\'a0a\'a0resilient\'a0economy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour\'92s missions will provide a clear signal and organising framework for business and set the overall\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 direction for the party\'92s policy interventions on growth.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Equalities\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 Just as a Labour government would unlock the potential of communities across the country to contribute to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 growth, it would unlock the potential of di\uc0\u64256 erent groups currently underrepresented in certain parts of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 economy. For example, the Start-Up Review highlighted the potential for the British Business Bank to direct\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more funding to women and Black, Asian and minority ethnic founders.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Devolution\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 Under Labour, the economy will be run for working people in all parts of the country. Labour knows Britain\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 succeeds only when everyone contributes. Labour will devolve power, wealth and opportunity, to every\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 place in Britain so that people can determine their own future and grow their local economy\cf0 \cb1 \
