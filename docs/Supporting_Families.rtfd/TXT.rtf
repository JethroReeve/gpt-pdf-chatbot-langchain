\f0 \cf6 \cb3 \strokec6 The context\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 Labour celebrates and cherishes the wonderful diversity of all families and households across Britain.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Labour Party wants to build a Britain that supports family life and brings genuine security to everyone.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 A country that gives our children the best possible start in life, enabling them to thrive in childhood and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 beyond; an economy that supports families to have a decent home, a good job and to lead a healthy,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well-balanced life; and an inclusive society that treats people with fairness and respect and that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 guarantees security and dignity in retirement.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Thirteen years of managed decline by the Conservatives has made this much harder to achieve. Families\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have been left exposed to worsening living standards, deteriorating public services and cuts to social\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 security. People\'92s concerns over their household budgets are even more acute after the Conservatives\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 crashed the economy and sent the cost of mortgages soaring. In\uc0\u64258 ation having been at a forty-year high,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 combined with anaemic economic growth, means that wages are now lower in real-terms than when the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Conservatives came to o\uc0\u64259 ce in 2010.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Before 2010, few people had even heard of a foodbank; now, they\'92re being set-up in hospitals where\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 some NHS sta\uc0\u64256  can\'92t keep pace with the spiralling cost of living. More than two million emergency food\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 parcels were distributed by the Trussell Trust last year. Over 800,000 of those parcels were for children,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a clear indication that child poverty has risen and deepened over the last thirteen years and remains\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 worryingly high under the Conservatives. Levels of poverty among disabled people have also soared under\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the Conservative government and poverty is forecast to rise even further over the coming years.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 With families feeling a squeeze on their living standards, it\'92s even more essential that childcare is a\uc0\u64256 ordable\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and accessible. Yet, under the Conservatives, the cost of childcare has soared, forcing many parents to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 cut back on their working hours or leave the labour market entirely. The rising cost of before- and after-\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 school clubs means they too are out of reach for many families, contributing to a widening attainment gap\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 between those families who can a\uc0\u64256 ord for their children to attend and those who can\'92t. Moreover, parents\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with atypical working hours, single parents and parents of disabled children face additional barriers \uc0\u64257 nding\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 accessible childcare.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The country is also in the grip of a housing crisis under the Conservatives. Average house prices are nine\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 times higher than average earnings and home ownership is a distant dream for millions of families. People\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 living in the private rented sector face insecurity and have seen their rents sky-rocket. The Conservatives\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 have failed to build the number of homes needed and failed to su\uc0\u64259 ciently invest in social and council\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 housing. Meanwhile, more than 120,000 children are living in temporary accommodation, a rise of two-thirds\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 since the Conservatives came to o\uc0\u64259 ce.\cf0 \cb1 \

\f0 \cf6 \cb3 \strokec6 The future under Labour\'a0\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 The next Labour government will build a better future for families by addressing these challenges.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 On childcare, early years, social security, housing and equalities, Labour has set out ambitious and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 credible policies to secure the fairer future that families deserve. Labour\'92s challenge now is to ensure this\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 policy o\uc0\u64256 er is fully developed and re\u64257 ned and that the party responds as circumstances and the economic\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 climate changes.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour will support families by making childcare available and a\uc0\u64256 ordable as a Labour government moves\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Britain towards a modern childcare system that supports families from the end of parental leave through\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to the end of primary school. As a \uc0\u64257 rst step on that road, a Labour government will deliver breakfast clubs,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 which are crucial for children\'92s learning and development, in every primary school in England. Labour will\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 fund these breakfast clubs and their workforce from the money raised by removing the non-domiciled tax\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 status, a clear indication that, with Labour, children and families will come \uc0\u64257 rst, not the privileged few.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 As part of Labour\'92s plans to ease the pressure on parents struggling to \uc0\u64257 nd childcare places, Labour will also\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 remove legal barriers to councils delivering new childcare facilities, and ensure local authorities can use\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 their revenue raising powers to support them. Labour will build on this with ambitious plans to expand early\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 years support for families.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour will reform social security so that it works for families and works to defeat child poverty, rather than\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 entrenching it. Labour will develop a culture of respect and dignity across the social security system, rather\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 than one of threats and punitive sanctions. In government, Labour will overhaul Universal Credit so that it\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 provides genuine \uc0\u64257 nancial security, prevents and reduces poverty, reduces inequalities and promotes and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 protects women\'92s \uc0\u64257 nancial independence.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour\'92s social security system will ensure that older people have the security and dignity in retirement that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 they deserve. Pensioners have been at the sharp end of the cost of living crisis due to soaring energy bills\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and the real-terms value of the state pension falling signi\uc0\u64257 cantly over the 2022/23 \u64257 nancial year. While the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Government repeatedly wavered, Labour remained steadfast in our commitment that the state pension\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 should be uprated by in\uc0\u64258 ation for the 2023/24 \u64257 nancial year.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The next Labour government will support families into decent work, helping people \uc0\u64257 nd high-quality and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ful\uc0\u64257 lling employment. Our ambition is for Britain to have the highest employment rate in the G7. Labour will\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 achieve this by reforming Jobcentres and employment support to make work pay and to o\uc0\u64256 er specialist\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and localised help. The Labour Party will give local areas the tools they need to deliver universal jobs\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 support and to tackle the rising tide of economic inactivity.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 This was an important recommendation by the Commission on the UK\'92s Future, led by Gordon Brown, whose\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \uc0\u64257 nal report was published in December 2022. The commission emphasised that a new, local approach\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to employment support could help people \uc0\u64257 nd the right opportunities and help businesses \u64257 nd the skilled\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 workers they need. The commission also recommended making Jobcentres more open, including to those\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 looking to upskill or to run their own business.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The commission also proposed a package of basic rights regarding health, education, poverty and housing.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 On tackling poverty, it proposed a basic right that no child, family or elderly citizen need live in poverty, that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every person legitimately present in the UK should be entitled to social assistance and that no person should\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 be left destitute. On housing, the commission proposed that it should be a basic right that every person be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 entitled to decent accommodation.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour agrees that housing is a fundamental human right and that homes should be safe, secure and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 genuinely a\uc0\u64256 ordable. That\'92s why the next Labour government will be the \u64257 rst in a generation to restore\cf0 \cb1 \

\f0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 social housing to the second largest form of tenure, bringing homes back into the ownership of local\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 councils and communities. Labour will also close loopholes that developers use to wriggle out of a\uc0\u64256 ordable\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 housing commitments, ensuring that local councils have stronger powers to deliver the a\uc0\u64256 ordable housing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that\'92s needed, not the housing that will make the most pro\uc0\u64257 t for developers.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 To support more families into owning their own home, Labour will set a new home ownership target of 70\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 per cent. Labour will aim to reach this target by building more homes and stopping foreign buyers from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 buying homes o\uc0\u64256 -plan before local people get a look in. Under Labour, \u64257 rst time buyers will have \u64257 rst dibs on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 new build homes and will be supported through a mortgage insurance scheme, enabling more families to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 secure a mortgage without having to save eye-watering deposits or rely on gifts from family members.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The next Labour government will also bring security to families who are renting. Labour will introduce a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 powerful new Private Renters Charter that will make renting fairer, more secure and more a\uc0\u64256 ordable. Labour\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 will achieve this through a higher-quality and properly regulated private rented sector. Labour will also\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 set out an ambition to re-establish the link between genuinely a\uc0\u64256 ordable housing and average earnings,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 bringing a\uc0\u64256 ordable rents and the dream of home ownership closer for those locked out today.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Equality will be at the heart of all of Labour\'92s policies for families, as the party look to build a more inclusive,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 more tolerant and more accessible society. A Labour government will make it illegal to make a new mother\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 redundant from noti\uc0\u64257 cation of pregnancy until six months after their return to work, except in speci\u64257 c\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 circumstances, and Labour will urgently review the failing system of shared parental leave.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour believes in a social model of disability and the next Labour government will remove societal barriers\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that restrict opportunities for disabled people. Labour supports the principle that policies for disabled people\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 should be produced in partnership with disabled people. A Labour government will replace the current\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 system of disability assessments with a more humane framework that treats people with dignity and respect\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and we will tackle disability discrimination in employment, including taking action to close disability pay\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 gaps.\cf0 \cb1 \
