\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf6 \cb3 \strokec6 The context\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 As 2023 begins, public services are under immense pressure. The combined impact of 13 years of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Conservative underfunding, neglect, and mismanagement, a global pandemic, soaring energy costs, and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 spiralling in\uc0\u64258 ation is limiting services\'92 ability to give security and support to communities around the country.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The NHS in England went into the pandemic with an acute sta\uc0\u64259 ng crisis and a waiting list that had soared\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 from 2.4 million in 2010 to 4.4 million in 2020. Now, services are faced with a backlog of care and are not yet\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 back to pre-pandemic activity levels. Preventative services are lagging behind; almost one million fewer\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 women a year are being screened for breast and cervical cancer compared to a decade ago. Despite\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 huge shortfalls and inequalities in women\'92s healthcare, the Government has failed to deliver on its own\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 women\'92s health strategy. Urgent and emergency care is in crisis. Ambulance crews routinely queue for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 hours outside hospitals because A&E departments are full, and the average response time to someone who\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 has had a suspected stroke or heart attack is 48 minutes.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Meanwhile, mental health services are facing extraordinary demand as people reel from the impact of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 isolation and hardship, with children and young people particularly a\uc0\u64256 ected. 44 per cent of children and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 young people who are referred for urgent treatment for an eating disorder wait three months or more.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Community care services haven\'92t got enough sta\uc0\u64256  to prevent people from going into hospital, and neither\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 do they have capacity to support all those who need continuing care after leaving. England has lost more\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 than 4,000 GPs and a \uc0\u64257 fth of all GP practices over the last decade. Now, millions of people wait over a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 month to see their GP and public satisfaction with GP services has fallen to 38 per cent - the lowest level\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 since records began and 39 percentage points below Labour\'92s last year in government.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Long-promised social care reforms have been postponed again, leaving thousands unable to access care.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Almost 35,000 people a year are estimated to die whilst waiting for social care, whilst almost 6,000 a year\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 run out of savings paying for their own care. This leaves unpaid carers to \uc0\u64257 ll gaps, with families forced to take\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 time out of work and lose income in order to care for their loved ones, often with little support or respite.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 In education, schools are being squeezed by soaring energy costs and will see no net growth in spending\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 per pupil from 2010 \'96 2024. Schools cannot \uc0\u64257 ll vacancies, school buildings are crumbling and attainment has\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 su\uc0\u64256 ered as a result of pandemic disruption. Children who are disabled and those with special educational\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 needs (SEND) are particularly disadvantaged by the Conservatives\'92 lack of ambition, with 1,500 children\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 with SEND who should be in education still waiting for a place at school. Further education is su\uc0\u64256 ering after\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a sustained period of Conservative neglect, while anticipating a predicted 160,000 extra students by 2024,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and our world-class universities are becoming \uc0\u64257 nancially unviable, with standards driven down for sta\u64256  and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 students as a result of the Government\'92s broken funding system and failed higher education policies.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Children\'92s social care is in a desperate state. Local authorities are often life lines for vulnerable children\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and families, but do not have the resources they need to reach those who could bene\uc0\u64257 t from support and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 intervention. This leaves too many vulnerable children at risk and facing disadvantage simply because of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the circumstances in which they were born.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Meanwhile, the dedicated sta\uc0\u64256  in our public services are working overtime to \u64257 ll workforce gaps and meet\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 record demand, without the fair pay and recognition they deserve. Many public service employees are\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 considering or taking industrial action as a result \'96 for example, in winter 2022/23 the Royal College of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Nursing in England took country-wide strike action for the \uc0\u64257 rst time in its history.\cf0 \cb1 \

\f0 \cf6 \cb3 \strokec6 The future under Labour\'a0\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 The next Labour government will address these challenges and secure \uc0\u64257 rst class public services for all.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Health and mental health services\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 Labour has set out a guiding principle that it will protect an NHS free at the point of use and secure health\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 care for all.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Using revenue raised through Labour\'92s commitments to end tax exemptions for private schools and scrap\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a tax loophole enjoyed by a small number of private equity fund managers, the next Labour government\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 will introduce an ambitious plan to improve mental health care. This includes guaranteed mental health\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 treatment within a month of referral, the \uc0\u64257 rst ever long-term, whole-government plan to improve mental\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 health outcomes, 8,500 new sta\uc0\u64256 , fair funding for mental health services, specialist mental health support in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 every school, and an open access mental health hub for children and young people in every community.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour will tackle the root cause of capacity challenges in the NHS with the most ambitious expansion of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the health workforce in history. The next Labour government will close tax loopholes for non doms and use\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the money to double the number of medical school places, train 10,000 new nurses and midwives each\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 year, double the number of district nurses\'a0qualifying every year, and train 5,000 new health\'a0visitors a year.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour is also committed to long term workforce planning for health and care, focusing on retention as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 well as recruitment, producing independent projections of the numbers of sta\uc0\u64256  the UK needs to ensure our\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 workforce is \uc0\u64257 t for a future of new health challenges and opportunities, creating new types of professionals\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 that draw on a diverse skills mix, creating new career paths, and reviewing existing training pathways. A\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour government will also reform the pension rules that currently discourage senior clinicians from staying\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 in the health service.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour will shift the focus of health care to prevention and early intervention, with a ten year plan for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 change and modernisation of the NHS to shift the focus out of hospital and into the community where\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 possible. Labour is developing detailed policy in this area and is working on our approach to primary care,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 dental care, and public health in particular, with a focus on tackling health inequalities linked to gender,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 race and ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and income. Labour is keen to hear respondents\'92 thoughts on these\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 areas to feed into policy development.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Social Care\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 Once in government, Labour will embark on a plan for reform that will act as a roadmap to a world-class\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 National Care Service with just as much ambition as the 1945 government that brought in the NHS.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour has set out its priorities for reform:\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95 Transform access\'a0to\'a0care, making sure\'a0every older\'a0and\'a0disabled person\'a0who\'a0needs care\'a0and support\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 can get it when and where they need it;\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95 Act\'a0on the\'a0principles of\'a0prevention and early\'a0intervention -\'a0a \'93Home First\'94\'a0approach;\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0Give\'a0disabled\'a0adults\'a0choice\'a0and\'a0control\'a0over\'a0their\'a0support;\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95 Establish\'a0a New\'a0Deal for Care\'a0Workers\'a0to ensure\'a0they get\'a0the job\'a0security they\'a0deserve, and\'a0the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 rewards they have earned; and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \'a0\'95 Establish\'a0a new\'a0partnership with\'a0families to\'a0ensure they\'a0don\'92t put themselves\'a0at risk\'a0for looking\'a0after\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people they love.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour will recruit and retain more carers by ensuring full rights at work, decent standards, fair pay, and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 proper training. Adult social care will bene\uc0\u64257 t from a Fair Pay Agreement as the \u64257 rst priority of a Labour\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 government, negotiated through collective bargaining between unions and employer representatives.\cf0 \cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 A Labour government will ensure money invested in social care is spent on social care and will not tolerate\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 poor quality, extractive providers. Under Labour, no private equity \uc0\u64257 rm will be able to pro\u64257 t from running\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 care homes while paying their care workers less than they need to live on. All providers will be required to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 demonstrate \uc0\u64257 nancial sustainability, responsible tax practices, and good employment conditions with high\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 quality care for service users. Labour is keen to hear respondents\'92 thoughts on next steps as we develop our\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 policy in this area, including looking towards stronger national standards to reduce inequalities in access\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to care.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f3\b \cf2 \cb3 Education and skills\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf2 \cb3 Labour\'92s vision for education is a system that can transform opportunities, grow our economy and provide\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a platform for a rewarding life. Every parent, no matter where they live, should be able to send their child to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 a high-quality school that prepares them for the future, and ensures they leave education ready for work,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 onwards education, and life.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The next Labour government will roll out an ambitious school improvement plan, investing in the people that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 keep schools running. Labour\'92s National Excellence Programme will be paid for by ending tax exemptions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 for private schools and will recruit new teachers, refocus regulation to improve support to struggling\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 schools, provide further continuing professional development for sta\uc0\u64256 , and equip all school leaders with the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 knowledge and skills to lead outstanding organisations. Labour is working to develop policy that supports\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 inclusion and high standards for vulnerable and SEND children and those who are disabled or have special\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 educational needs, so that every child can go to a high-quality school that supports and prepares them for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the future. Labour is keen to hear respondents\'92 thoughts on priorities in this areas.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 In order to ensure high standards across the sector, Labour will make the national curriculum compulsory,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ensure all teachers have quali\uc0\u64257 ed status, and establish national standards for support sta\u64256 . The next Labour\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 government will require academies to cooperate with local authorities to ensure fair admissions and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 will introduce inspections for multi-academy trusts to ensure e\uc0\u64256 ective oversight. Labour will implement a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 national strategy with clear targets to close the attainment gap and will also work with local and regional\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 government in England to review the school curriculum.\cf0 \cb1 \
