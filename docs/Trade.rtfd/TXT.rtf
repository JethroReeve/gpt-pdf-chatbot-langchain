\cf2 \cb3 Introduction\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 The National Policy Forum (NPF) is entering the \uc0\u64257 nal year of the current policy cycle,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 which will culminate in a full, in-person meeting of the NPF to determine Labour\'92s policy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 platform. That platform will in turn contribute towards an election-winning manifesto for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 the next general election.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 The Britain in the World policy commission and its predecessor commissions have\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 consulted on a range of policy topics over the previous three years:\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0In\'a02020,\'a0on\'a0championing\'a0internationalism\'a0in\'a0the\'a0post-coronavirus\'a0world;\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 \'95 In 2021, on a strategy for veterans; and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 \'a0\'95\'a0In\'a02022,\'a0on\'a0protecting\'a0our\'a0national\'a0interests and\'a0promoting\'a0Labour\'a0values abroad.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 For this fourth and \uc0\u64257 nal year, the Britain in the World policy commission has chosen\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 to focus on Labour\'92s progressive trade policy. We welcome submissions on this issue\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 \'a0\'96 and speci\uc0\u64257 cally the seven consultation questions set out below \'96 from Constituency\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 and Branch Labour Parties, a\uc0\u64259 liated trade unions and socialist societies, as well\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 as contributions from expert third party organisations such as charities, think tanks,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 businesses and civil society. Full details on how to make a submission can be found\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 on\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf4 \cb3 www.policyforum.labour.org.uk.\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf4 \cb3 The outcomes of all four consultations will then be taken into account when the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 commission produces its draft policy document for consideration at the full NPF meeting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 in July 2023.\cf0 \cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 The context\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 Britain\'92s trading relationships with the world are a key component of its foreign policy, providing an\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 opportunity to boost economic growth at home while promoting British values and interests abroad. Yet as\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 we approach the next general election, global trade faces a set of unprecedented challenges.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 The outbreak of Covid-19 sent shockwaves across the international economic system, and global supply\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 chains have struggled to recover from the disruption of national lockdowns, including the dramatic\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 contraction and subsequent resurgence in demand for goods and services. This is not something that\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 has been and gone; many countries continue to deal with outbreaks of the virus in 2023.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Meanwhile, Russia\'92s illegal invasion of Ukraine has led to soaring energy costs across Europe and driven\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 a global food crisis. Manufacturing costs have increased and household budgets have been squeezed,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 placing signi\uc0\u64257 cant strain on the everyday lives of working people.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 In Britain, the challenges of global trade have been exacerbated by almost 13 years of Conservative\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 mismanagement, recklessness and neglect.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Having overseen our withdrawal from the European Union, the Conservative government failed to deliver\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 on the trade promises they made, with the UK economy left paying the price. Instead of prioritising exports,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 growth and jobs across the UK, or taking a lead on using trade to tackle the climate crisis and workers\'92\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 rights, Conservatives simply cut and paste pre-existing deals that were negotiated decades ago.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 In their 2019 manifesto, the Conservatives promised that 80 per cent of Britain\'92s trade would be covered\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 by free trade agreements by the end of 2022, yet they have now missed their own deadline.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 This failure to deliver on trade targets is incredibly damaging, leaving the UK economy missing out on billions\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 of pounds of potential opportunities that could boost growth here in the UK.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Boris Johnson and Liz Truss repeatedly promised new trade deals with India and the US, but these are yet\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 to materialise.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Out of the few trade deals that have been signed, almost all have fallen short. Instead of aiming for\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 ambitious new trade deals with international partners, the Conservatives have rushed around in search of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 the quickest agreements they can \uc0\u64257 nd, with no questions asked.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 The Australian trade deal failed to include binding commitments on climate targets and risks undercutting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 UK farmers through the removal of import tari\uc0\u64256 s. By the Conservatives\'92 own admission,\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f4\i \cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 \'93the UK gave away\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 far too much for far too little in return\'94\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\i0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 \'a0when negotiating the Australia deal.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 In its negotiations with the EU, the Government\'92s antagonistic approach repeatedly undermined progress\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 and soured key relationships, limiting any chance of a new kind of progressive agreement. The last minute\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 deal was far from what was promised, with signi\uc0\u64257 cant gaps that make trading with European partners much\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 more burdensome than before..\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Moving into 2023, the Northern Ireland Protocol impasse remains one of the most damming examples of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Conservatives\'92 failure on the international stage, with progress remaining slow. In government, Labour must\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 immediately get to work on securing a better deal for British people.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 After 13 years of Conservative government, Britain\'92s reputation as a reliable and trusted partner has\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 been signi\uc0\u64257 cantly damaged. On trade, it is clear the Conservatives have no strategy, which is costing jobs,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 investment and growth. Labour knows that Britain deserves better.\cf0 \cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 The future under Labour\'a0\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 In light of our withdrawal from the EU, Britain will need to develop a bespoke and \uc0\u64258 exible trade policy that is\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 \uc0\u64257 t for the future.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Negotiating an independent trading policy will be a signi\uc0\u64257 cant challenge for a future Labour government.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 It will fall to Labour to grow the UK\'92s economy and show that Britain can once again be a force for good on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 the international stage.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Heading into the next election, it is clear that Labour is the party of economic growth. The Labour Party\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 has already set out a clear plan to make Britain and its people better o\uc0\u64256 , giving the country the fresh start\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 it needs.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 International trade will be a vital part of this, helping deliver jobs at home while promoting Britain\'92s principles\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 abroad. From defending workers\'92 rights to tackling the climate crisis, the Labour Party has the opportunity to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 develop a comprehensive trade policy that puts Labour values into action.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Building on the commission\'92s previous consultation, where the NPF looked at the importance of promoting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Labour\'92s internationalist values through multilateral alliances, promoting aid and bolstering democratic\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 systems, the commission will this year look to develop the party\'92s position on trade.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 The starting point must be the restoration of Britain\'92s reputation as a trusted partner, both to our closest\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 neighbours in Europe and our allies further a\uc0\u64257 eld. Labour has already outlined plans to scrap the treaty-\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 breaking Protocol Bill and deliver real progress to ease trade, key \uc0\u64257 rst steps in building a new working\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 relationship with Europe and solving the Northern Ireland issue.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 The Labour Party will make Brexit work outside of the single market and the customs union, helping to move\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 the country on from the arguments and divisions of the past. The veterinary agreement Labour will seek with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 the EU would eliminate most checks in agricultural goods, but there is much more to do.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Labour will seek to use trade policy to boost the economy and promote jobs, to create a trading\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 environment that works for Britain. The UK is home to some of the best and most innovative businesses in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 the world, but they need the right platform to thrive. Labour\'92s international trade policy must support this,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 particularly for businesses who rely on global supply chains.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Importantly, Labour understands that the bene\uc0\u64257 ts of trade must be felt across the whole of the UK.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 The country simply cannot go on with a situation where just 1.4 per cent of exports are from the North\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 East and less than 5 per cent of exports originate from the East Midlands, compared to 25 per cent from\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 London and 21 per cent from the South East.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 The recent Commission on the UK\'92s Future chaired by Gordon Brown highlighted this disparity,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 recommending a bigger role for devolved leaders as one way of tackling regional inequality.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Labour is keen to build on this, and is looking at how a Labour government can further open up\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 services and use trade to help level up across our regions and nations.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Following the recent disruption of the global pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Labour must consider what\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 lessons to learn about the resilience of international trade to global events and use trade policy to better\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 secure the UK\'92s supply chains. This could include working closer with allies and partners to strengthen the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 international trading system.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 To tackle the climate crisis and seize the economic opportunities of decarbonisation, Labour has set out\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 plans to drive green British exports. At Annual Conference 2022, Shadow International Trade Secretary Nick\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Thomas-Symonds explained how a new network of Climate Export Hubs will work with businesses, universities\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 and other innovators to take UK climate science innovations and export them to the world. These export\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 hubs will support every region in the country \'96 helping to create skilled jobs and opportunities nationwide.\cf0 \cb1 \

\f0 \cf4 \cb3 \strokec5 Together with new rules to ensure that trade negotiators have binding responsibilities to deliver for the whole\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 of the UK, Labour\'92s trade policy will help ensure that Britain becomes a global leader in the race to net zero.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 These are strong \uc0\u64257 rst steps in the party\'92s work to build a greener and fairer trade policy, but the commission\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 is keen to hear what more the party can do.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Workers\'92 rights must be the heart of Britain\'92s trade policy. Labour opposes a global race to the bottom on\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 standards and rights.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 At home, this involves supporting wages and conditions in every sector of the UK economy. Labour can look\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 to examples such as the new era of partnership in Wales, where the devolved government is working with\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 business and unions to co-develop policy, as positive examples of civic engagement. This will help Labour\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 to determine the best way of involving key partners, not just in relation to workers\'92 rights chapters, but to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 entire trade agreements. Internationally, this involves standing up for workers, often including women and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 children, who are forced to work in extreme conditions. The UK must establish an e\uc0\u64256 ective means of working\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 with key international players, including China, on issues such as the climate crisis while calling out cases of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 abuses of human rights.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Alongside an e\uc0\u64256 ective international development strategy, fair trade can play a key part in tackling poverty\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 and global inequality, a key goal for a future Labour government.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Above all else, Labour sees trade as a force for good. In government, Labour will secure deals that bring\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 investment while also promoting rights, climate action and ensuring higher standards. A Labour trade policy\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 should support future green jobs, promote technology and innovation and embrace a digital future.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 Through this consultation, the Britain in the World commission looks forward to receiving a wide range of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 thoughts and ideas on Labour\'92s future trade policy, helping build the party\'92s international policy platform in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf4 \cb3 this important \uc0\u64257 nal year of the NPF cycle\cf0 \cb1 \
