\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf6 \cb3 \strokec6 The context\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 The last 13 years of Conservative government have left our communities more divided, unequal and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 vulnerable. The pandemic has had a lasting impact on our communities and the cost of living crisis presents\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 both immediate and future challenges. Yet, the Conservatives have prioritised their own political future\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ahead of building stronger community cohesion and security.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The poorest areas have been hit the hardest, with the deepest cuts often being in\uc0\u64258 icted upon local\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and neighbourhood services most in need, while \uc0\u64257 nancial support is handed out to those areas which\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are already better o\uc0\u64256 . Labour will seek to rebalance power, give local people more control over their\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 communities and build a fairer future for everyone.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Ensuring our communities are safe and that people feel secure in their homes and local neighbourhoods\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 should be one of the top priorities for any government. Yet the Conservatives have spent a decade cutting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 our police and \uc0\u64257 re service workforces, leaving communities across the country exposed.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 There are thousands fewer Police Community Support O\uc0\u64259 cers than in 2010, and neighbourhood policing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 has been slashed in the past eight years alone. The percentage of people saying they never see the police\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 out on foot patrol has almost doubled since the Conservatives came to power in 2010.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Con\uc0\u64257 dence and trust in our police have plummeted and it is the sad reality that in 21st century Britain many\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 people have given up reporting neighbourhood crime, as they believe nothing will come of it. Our police\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 lack the ability to respond quickly to crimes, investigate them thoroughly and hold those responsible to\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 account. The overall charge rate is at the devastatingly low level of 5.5 per cent and the total number of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 arrests has fallen sharply since 2010.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Furthermore, serious violent crime is increasing, with speci\uc0\u64257 c types of knife crime surging to their highest\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 point on record. Online crime and fraud have also risen to unprecedented levels, and the number of\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 sexual o\uc0\u64256 ences being recorded by the police has now reached a record high.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Despite this, diversion schemes and preventative services have been decimated, particularly those\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 available to young people. Between 2010 and 2020 more than 4,500 youth work jobs were cut,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and 760 youth centres closed. Cuts to youth services funding have left our young people without\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the safe spaces they need, and access to mental health services for many is virtually impossible.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The Conservatives have also eroded public faith in our constitution and political institutions. From the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 granting of peerages to ex-Conservative sta\uc0\u64256  members to the decision to award contracts during the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 pandemic to businesses with connections to the Conservative Party, it is clear greater scrutiny and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 accountability must shape the future of the UK\'92s constitution, so it re\uc0\u64258 ects our modern democratic values.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The UK remains one of the most centralised democratic countries in the whole world and has one of the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 highest income inequalities in Europe. While there have been some welcome developments in recent\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 years, such as the expansion of regional Mayors and Police and Crime Commissioners, the Government\'92s\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 approach to devolution and constitutional reform has been far too slow and too narrow.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 The overall focus of this year\'92s commission is therefore how Labour can empower our communities more\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 broadly and strengthen neighbourhood cohesion, in particular, with the aim of reducing crime.\cf0 \cb1 \

\f0 \cf6 \cb3 \strokec6 The future under Labour\'a0\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 Strengthening neighbourhood cohesion will be a key priority for the next Labour government, as every\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 person and every family has a basic right to feel safe. It is Labour\'92s mission to drive down crime and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 anti-social behaviour, put more police in local areas, stand up for community services and empower\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 victims. Our communities deserve a stronger and brighter future.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Ensuring our police have the necessary resources, equipment and skills will be essential for Labour in\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 achieving this mission. Labour has already pledged to bring back neighbourhood policing by putting\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 13,000 more neighbourhood police on Britain\'92s streets, including recruiting at least 10,000 more o\uc0\u64259 cers,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 PCSOs and specials. This is the equivalent of giving every constituency in England and Wales 15-20 extra\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 neighbourhood police.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Furthermore, Labour has brought forward plans to tackle the increase in several types of serious violence,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 such as knife crime. By cracking down on knife supply, such as increasing enforcement against online black\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 market sales, introducing heightened surveillance, hotspot policing and analysing the geographical pattern\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 of where knife attacks have taken place, Labour will be able to act on one of the most serious threats our\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 communities face.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Previously, Labour has outlined a package of measures that would help tackle the epidemic of violence\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 against women and girls, in a green paper published in 2021. Proposals include introducing a\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 new statutory minimum sentence for rape of seven years, whole life tari\uc0\u64256 s for those who rape, abduct,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and murder, as well as criminalising street harassment.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 More recently, Labour has committed to rolling out specialist rape courts that would also fast-track rape\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 cases and better support victims, in addition to introducing a new Domestic Violence Register that would\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 allow for better police and law enforcement monitoring of perpetrators and help to identify o\uc0\u64256 ending\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 patterns more quickly.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 This was accompanied by a pledge to deliver specialist support for victims, by putting domestic abuse\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 experts into 999 control rooms and rape investigation units in every force to get justice for women.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Everyone has the right to live free from fear and these are practical measures which will help tackle\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 the crisis.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 A Labour government would advocate for and embed at every level the principle that victims should be\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 at the heart of our criminal justice system. It was under a Labour government that the Victims\'92 Code was\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 drawn up and the post of Victims\'92 Commissioner created. Labour will look to build on this positive record\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and measures already put forward.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour would strengthen community sentences and create Community and Victim Payback Boards to act\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 on antisocial behaviour and stop more serious reo\uc0\u64256 ending at source. Victims and other local representatives\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 will be given a role in deciding what unpaid work o\uc0\u64256 enders must undertake, such as removing gra\u64259 ti,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 clearing wasteland or redecorating community centres.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour understands that public trust in our police is critical to keeping people safe, particularly among\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 marginalised communities and people that have been victims of discrimination. Labour has consistently\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 called for an overhaul of our police standards system and would introduce mandatory professional\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 standards for every police force, as well as reforming vetting processes. Policing by consent is an essential\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 part of Britain\'92s criminal justice system and Labour would end the postcode lottery on police standards\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 which undermines the important work we need the police to do.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Labour will also seek to tackle the root causes of the problems that our communities face. By introducing\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 stronger preventative action involving local government, schools and community organisations, charities\cf0 \cb1 \

\f0 \cf2 \cb3 \strokec4 and frontline providers, we can urgently identify and protect those at risk of being drawn into violence.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 It means restoring youth projects and treatment services, building upon the positive work Labour councils\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 are already doing around community cohesion and intervention.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 To ensure that the increased police workforce can be as e\uc0\u64256 ective as possible, we must also understand the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 challenges anti-social behaviour presents to our communities and how agencies can work best together\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to ensure safe and secure communities. The commission would welcome respondents\'92 thoughts on how\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 supporting community-led strategies in tackling youth violence can encourage people to reintegrate and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 take pride in their local community.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Giving local people more control over their local area can help us tackle crime, build community safety,\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 and increase political engagement. A Labour government will introduce a Take Back Control Act within the\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 \uc0\u64257 rst King\'92s Speech to establish clear frameworks for local leaders to request, negotiate and take on powers\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 over economic policymaking, establishing a presumption towards moving power our of Westminster and\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 ensuring local areas can bid for any powers that have already been devolved elsewhere.\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Following the publication of the report by the Commission on the UK\'92s Future, chaired by former Prime\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 Minister Gordon Brown, we must consider how devolution and constitutional reform can act as another\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 tool in driving community participation in politics. Advocating for the transfer of power from Westminster\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 to the people and their local areas will be a key pledge for Labour and the commission would welcome\cf0 \cb1 \
\cf2 \cb3 respondents\'92 thoughts on the recommendations contained within the report.\cf0 \cb1 \
